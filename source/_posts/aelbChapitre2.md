In 2020 I started sewing again. I made my first jackets based on a pattern I drew from a second hand jacket I found at a Guerrida shop.

I've been willing for 2 years to make a sewing project with some kind of data visualization involved. Since I saw the Arte documentary "Fashion Geek", I follow and admire the work of <a href="https://www.claradaguin.com" target="_self" class="link" >Clara Daguin</a> and <a href="http://yinggao.ca" target="_self" class="link">Ying Gao</a>. They both include elecronic devices in clothes to convey impressions, and to explore the interfaces between body and technology.

I've been making 2 jackets, 2 shorts and I'll try to make 2 hats and 2 bags. I want to use geospatial sensors attached to the clothes, and then use the data to produce sounds made of samples. The sound would be linked to the movement. For this I need to do a few things :

<ul class="list">
    <li>Find or draw appropriate patterns</li>
    <li>Sew the clothes</li>
    <li>Setup the sensors with a Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>Setup the server that saves the data</li>
    <li>Build the interface that reads it</li>
    <li>Write the algorithm that produces the sounds</li>
    <li>Record the movement of the clothes and film it</li>
    <li>Create a video with both sound generated and images</li>
</ul>

None of this points is finished yet, but I've started working on all of them.
